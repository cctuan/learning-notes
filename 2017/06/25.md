# AWS, AMI, AutoScalingGroup, EB, Volume, Snapshot

## Why?
Currently, all the local change on wordpress will not sync with other server under same scalegroup, neither when the new server created by EB.

## Studied Items
### Keywords of AWS
#### Volume
Volume is mounted on the current ec instances, sometime there would be serveral volume on one instance, for ex. /dev/sda1 .

#### Snapshot
EC instance will automatically create new snapshot daily, however, we can also create new snapshot based on the volume we select.

#### AMI (Image)
Create Image based on snapshot or server directly, one image can have serveral snapshot by device (ex. /dev/sda1).

We can also create new EC instance based from image directly.

#### AutoScalingGroup
Scaling group can assign multi policy such as create/remove/set a instance, and can cusomize the trigger points.

Normally, EB will have 1 autoScalingGroup by default.

#### EB (elastic beanstalk)
Automatically create instances, autoScalingGroup, security group ... so on.

### Idea
* Need a way to create new instance based on assigned image, including all plugins/downloads/themes
* Need a way to sync local files routine between deployed server and base image.
* **IMPORTANT** need a way to ignore normal eb deploy script, since eb will override existing file system...

# TODO
Still working on how to ignore overriding.
